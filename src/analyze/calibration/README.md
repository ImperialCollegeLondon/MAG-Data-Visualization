# Sensor Calibration Data

Sensor calibration data is organized by sensor (e.g., FM5), by range (0 to 3) and temperature.

For temperatures, the following scales apply:

- Room Temperature: approx. 20 °C (FM5), 26 °C (FM4)
- Cool Temperature: approx. -10 °C (FM5), 0 °C (FM4)
- Cold Temperature: approx. -20 °C (FM5), -30 °C (FM4)

Data was extracted from calibration report by IGEP. The misalignment matrix is represented by the reduced transfermatrix, which combines misalignment and scale factor.
